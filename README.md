# metaballs

Metaballs are a way to meld together shapes when they get close together, creating a neat and dynamic blobby shape. You can see an example below, where bouncing balls automatically blend together when they're nearby.
It works using isolines!

I learned about metaballs and the math behind them from [Jamie Wong](http://jamie-wong.com/2014/08/19/metaballs-and-marching-squares/).
